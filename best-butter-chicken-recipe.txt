Directions
Melt butter in a deep, 10-inch skillet over medium heat; add onions and garlic; cook slowly, stirring often, until onions are tender - about five minutes.
Add gingerroot, chili powder, turmeric and cinnamon; cook one more minute.
Add undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, salt and pepper; reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add cut-up chicken, cream and sour cream; simmer, uncovered, for five more minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in cilantro; serve over hot basmati rice, if desired.
